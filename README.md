# Running the front-end
Note: We created our front-end with streamlit. If you do not have streamlit already installed on your computer, you may have to do so. The following link has instructions for installation: https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation

After you have streamlit downloaded on your computer, you can follow these steps to invoke our front-end: 
1. Download fake_job_postings.csv and web.py. Make sure both of these files are in the same directory.
2. Open up your terminal. Make sure that you are in the same directory as both of these files. If needed, cd into the appropriate directory.
3. In your terminal, run the following command: streamlit run web.py

The streamlit front-end should now be open in your browser.
